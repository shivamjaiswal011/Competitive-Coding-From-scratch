Question: Why we find it ?

To calculate how much time our program will take in seconds for the worst case  scenario and see if it's within the constraints or not.
         
     Constraints are probably the most important part of the problem.

1. They can give you exact time complexity that is needed to pass all test cases .
2. They can tell you the space complexity that you will be needed.
3. They can tell you about data type that you should be using.

        Part 1. Time Complexity 

Most of the platforms uses 1 sec to perform 10^8 operations 

Suppose you perform x operations

10^8 operations = 1 sec
x operation will take = x/10^8 secs

    Generally you will have the time limit of 1-2 secs to pass all the test cases 

So your number of operation must not exceed 10^8 operations.

    How to calculate number of operations ?

Suppose constraints of n is 1<=n<=10^7 

You have calculated that time complexity of your program is N*logN
If you want to calculate the number of operations then replace N with maximum value of N because if your maximum operation can be performed within the time limit, than less number
of operations can be performed easily.

So number of operations are= 10^7* log(10^7) = 7 * 10^7 assuming log base 10.
Now if you want time in seconds then that will be = 10^7 * 7 / 10^8 = 7* 10^-1 = 70 ms .

So its easy to observe that we just need to limit our number of operations to 10^8 for passing all test cases.

    How you can easily find the limit of your program's complexity according to given Constraints ?

Remember these constraints and the maximum time limit you can have for these constraints .

    Constraints              Time Complexity

    1<=N<=10^18              O( log N )

    1<=N<=10^8               O( N )
 
    1<=N<=10^7               O( N logN )

    1<=N<=10^4               O( N^2 )

    1<=N<=500                O( N^3 )

    1<=N<=90                 O( N^4 )

    1<=N<=20                 O( 2^N )

    1<=N<=10                 O( N! )


Some Commonly used For loops and their time Complexity

            For loops                          Their Corresponding time Complexity

    1. for( i=0;i<N:i++)                            O( N ) // For summation or subtraction

    2. for( i=0;i<N;i*=2)                           O( logN ) // for divison or multiplication  

    3. for(i=0;i<N;i++)                             O( NxN )  //for nested loops multiple all complexities
       {
         for(j=0;j<N;j++)
         //nested loops
       }

    Few other tips.

1. Always remember the time complexity for famous algorithms like divide and conquer it always results in logarithmic complexity.

2. Whenever you learn any built in functions always remember its time Complexity eg. sort()=N*logN.

3. Always find time complexity for the worst case.
